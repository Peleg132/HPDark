TODOs (Ordered by expected amount of effort to make each):
    - Ban yourself for a certain amout of time
    - Hide large signatures
    - Choose if "Edited by" line is displayed by default or not
    - Change default values in inputs to placeholders (HTML attribute)
    - Jump to page in forums
    - Add a button in a profile to send sickles (This is how you say חרמשים in english, according to my true love) to that user
    - More colors in the color selection GUI
    - More font-sizes in font-size selection GUI
    - Hide QUOTE/CODE blocks in a single comment/thread
    - More tags buttons
        + Examples: [S], [HTML], [SQl], others (maybe customiseable for future updates if needed)
    - Add source of quote and date in quote tag
    - Jump to page in home page
    - Separate yellow emojis from onions
    - Customiseable emojis and onions

    - Customiseable gender
        + Check if possible
    - List of categories in home page
    - More keyboard shortcuts
    - Personal helper
        + IDK if there are enough features in the built-in one, I might need to make a customised one
    - Copy comment's code without quoting it
        + Probably will rely on quoting it in iFrame or something similar.
        + Therefore, probably wouldnt be possible in locked threads
    - Send sickles or PMs to many users at the same time
    - Split or merge long/many PMs into long one/many short ones
        + Customiseable length to spliting 
    - WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get 
    - Better user-blocking
    - Auto-save text like threads, PMs, etc.
    - Different skins
    - Follow user's content, get notifications on new threads/comments
    - Track threads' new comments
    - Notifications on @me, quotes, comments in ur thread, etc. 
        + All can be turned off, if I'll have enough energy to do so
